# CS61B

**CS 61B: Data Structures** focus on Data Structures and Software Engineering Concepts.

I choose [course website (2021 spring)](https://sp21.datastructur.es/index.html) as the study material because its course material is complete enough. The Gradescope course activation code is **P5WVGW**.

I highly recommend **proj2 gitlet**, its about how to implement a mini git(vcs).

**proj3 byow** has not been finished yet on my repo, it's more complex about software engineering concepts, and I don't have enough energy to finish it.

**please don't copy my trash code :)**
